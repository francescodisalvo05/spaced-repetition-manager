# active-recall-ctmli
Simple python script for doing active recall on "Cracking The Machine Learning Interview" 

Ideas : 
* use an hidden list (for me) with the text of the question
* in order to avoid repeated question, use a temporary list with all the extracted questions per session (for each chapter)
* use as a consequence an argument for clearing the session (deleting the file)
